# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - the methods and final practice breakouts were a lot more challenging and fun than expected especially the array challenges
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - they allow for known behaviors and simplified coding to exist while also alowing for large changes to be made if the method is ever expanded/tweaked later
